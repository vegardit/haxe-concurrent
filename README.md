## <a name="what-is-it"></a>What is it?

A [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/documentation/using-haxelib/) that provides some basic platform agnostic concurrency support.

All classes are located in the package `hx.concurrent` or below.

The library has been extensively unit tested (over 400 individual test cases) on the targets C++, C#, [Eval](https://haxe.org/blog/eval/), Flash, [HashLink](https://hashlink.haxe.org/),
Java, JavaScript ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and PhantomJS), Lua, [Neko](https://nekovm.org/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 7 and [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.

**Note:**
- When targeting Flash the option `-swf-version 11.5` (or higher) must be specified, otherwise you will get `Class flash.concurrent::Condition could not be found.`
- When targeting C# the option `-D net-ver=45` must be specified, otherwise you may get `error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Volatile' does not exist in the namespace 'System.Threading'. Are you missing an assembly reference?`

## <a name="atomic-package"></a>The `hx.concurrent.atomic` package

The [hx.concurrent.atomic](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/atomic) package contains mutable value holder classes that allow for thread.safe manipulation:

- [AtomicBool](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/atomic/AtomicBool.hx)
- [AtomicInt](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/atomic/AtomicInt.hx)
- [AtomicValue](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/atomic/AtomicValue.hx)


## <a name="collection-package"></a>The `hx.concurrent.collection` package

The [hx.concurrent.collection](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/collection) package contains thread-safe implementations of different types of collections:

- [CopyOnWriteArray](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/collection/CopyOnWriteArray.hx)
- [Queue](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/collection/Queue.hx)
- [SynchronizedArray](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/collection/SynchronizedArray.hx)
- [SynchronizedLinkedList](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/collection/SynchronizedLinkedList.hx)
- [SynchronizedMap](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/collection/SynchronizedMap.hx)


## <a name="executor-package"></a>The `hx.concurrent.executor` package

The [hx.concurrent.executor](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/executor) package contains
[Executor](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/executor/Executor.hx) implementations that allow
to execute functions concurrently and to schedule tasks for later/repeated execution.

On platform with the thread support (C++, C#, Eval, HashLink, Neko, Python, Java) threads are used to realize true concurrent execution, on other
platforms `haxe.Timer` is used to at least realize async execution.

```haxe
import hx.concurrent.executor.Schedule;
import hx.concurrent.executor.Executor;

class Test {

   static function main() {
      var executor = Executor.create(3);  // <- 3 means to use a thread pool of 3 threads on platforms that support threads
      // depending on the platform either a thread-based or timer-based implementation is returned

      // define a function to be executed concurrently/async/scheduled (return type can also be Void)
      var myTask=function():Date {
         trace("Executing...");
         return Date.now();
      }

      // submit 10 tasks each to be executed once asynchronously/concurrently as soon as possible
      for(i in 0...10) {
         executor.submit(myTask);
      }

      executor.submit(myTask, ONCE(2000));            // async one-time execution with a delay of 2 seconds
      executor.submit(myTask, FIXED_RATE(200));       // repeated async execution every 200ms
      executor.submit(myTask, FIXED_DELAY(200));      // repeated async execution 200ms after the last execution
      executor.submit(myTask, HOURLY(30));            // async execution 30min after each full hour
      executor.submit(myTask, DAILY(3, 30));          // async execution daily at 3:30
      executor.submit(myTask, WEEKLY(SUNDAY, 3, 30)); // async execution Sundays at 3:30

      // submit a task and keep a reference to it
      var future = executor.submit(myTask, FIXED_RATE(200));

      // check if a result is already available
      switch(future.result) {
         case SUCCESS(value, time, _): trace('Successfully execution at ${Date.fromTime(time)} with result: $value');
         case FAILURE(ex, time, _):    trace('Execution failed at ${Date.fromTime(time)} with exception: $ex');
         case NONE(_):                 trace("No result yet...");
      }

      // check if the task is scheduled to be executed (again) in the future
      if(!future.isStopped) {
         trace('The task is scheduled for further executions with schedule: ${future.schedule}');
      }

      // cancel any future execution of the task
      future.cancel();
   }
}
```


## <a name="event-package"></a>The `hx.concurrent.event` package

The [hx.current.event](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/event) package contains classes for type-safe event dispatching.

```haxe
import hx.concurrent.event.AsyncEventDispatcher;
import hx.concurrent.event.SyncEventDispatcher;
import hx.concurrent.Future;
import hx.concurrent.executor.Executor;

class Test {

   static function main() {
      /**
       * create a dispatcher that notifies listeners/callbacks synchronously in the current thread
       */
      var syncDispatcher = new SyncEventDispatcher<String>(); // events are of type string

      // create event listener
      var onEvent = function(event:String):Void {
         trace('Received event: $event');
      }

      syncDispatcher.subscribe(onEvent);

      // notify all registered listeners synchronously,
      // meaning this method call blocks until all listeners are finished executing
      syncDispatcher.fire("Hey there");

      /**
       * create a dispatcher that notifies listeners asynchronously using an executor
       */
      var executor = Executor.create(5); // thread-pool with 5 threads
      var asyncDispatcher = new AsyncEventDispatcher<String>(executor);

      // create event listener
      var onAsyncEvent = function(event:String):Void {
         trace('Received event: $event');
      }

      // notify all registered listeners asynchronously,
      // meaning this method call returns immediately
      asyncDispatcher.fire("Hey there");

      // fire another event and get notified when all listeners where notified
      var future = asyncDispatcher.fire("Boom");

      asyncDispatcher.subscribe(onAsyncEvent);

      future.onResult = function(result:FutureResult<Dynamic>) {
         switch(result) {
            case SUCCESS(count, _): trace('$count listeners were successfully notified');
            case FAILURE(ex, _): trace('Event could not be delivered because of: $ex');
            case NONE(_): trace("Nothing is happening");
          }
      };

   }
}
```


## <a name="lock-package"></a>The `hx.concurrent.lock` package

The [hx.concurrent.lock](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/lock) package contains lock implementations for different purposes:

- [RLock](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/lock/RLock.hx) - a reentrant lock
- [RWLock](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/lock/RWLock.hx) - an upgradeable read-write lock
- [Semaphore](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/lock/Semaphore.hx)


## <a name="thread-package"></a>The `hx.concurrent.thread` package

The [hx.concurrent.thread](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/thread) package contains
classes for platforms supporting threads:

- [ThreadPool](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/thread/ThreadPool.hx) - basic thread-pool implementation supporting C++, C#, HashLink, Neko, Java and Python. For advanced concurrency or cross-platform requirements use [Executor](https://github.com/vegardit/haxe-concurrent/blob/main/src/hx/concurrent/executor/Executor.hx) instead.

    ```haxe
    import hx.concurrent.thread.*;

    class Test {

       static function main() {
          var pool = new ThreadPool(4); // 4 concurrent threads

          pool.submit(function(ctx:ThreadContext) {
             // do some work here
          });

          pool.awaitCompletion(30 * 1000); // wait 30 seconds for all submitted tasks to be processed

          pool.cancelPendingTasks(); // cancels execution of all currently queued tasks

          // initiate graceful stop of all running threads, i.e. they finish the current tasks they process
          // execution of all other queued tasks is cancelled
          pool.stop();
       }
    }
    ```
